    \"text\": \"Oh dear, they’ve become so poor. Despite COVID-19, I picked up a car recently that was very dirty inside, with lots of food debris, coffee stains and hairs all over the passenger seat. With this location, they do not appear to be doing any additional effective cleaning, despite the pandemic. Also please note that they make you pay for replacing flat tyres. There is a damage fee of £750 that you have to pay for various types of damage which includes “flat tyres, windscreen cracks, dead batteries (from leaving lights on) and engine problems”. As you can see, some of those issues will rarely be the fault of the person hiring the car. You can pay an extra £99 every year for a complete waiver. This is additional to the membership fee. But if you naively like me pay an extra £69 every year, it brings the damage fee down to £250 and of course the cost of repairing much of the damage listed comes in under that amount. So on a recent journey I personally had to pay for replacing a flat tyre. Zipcar were absolutely rigid on this. It was all particularly miserable because with the travel delay involved, we then missed timed entry tickets and had to come home and return the car early.\",

I have not used zipcar for over a month now so obviously I raised the enquiry as an the issue to their client email and theIr reply was and explanation of how to access my account, which you would think after over 3 years of being a member you pretty much know how to use. Zipcar is charging for something and tell you: find where the miss-charge happen as they have no idea What exactly they charge you. I am raising this as fraud as how can they charge something they cannot explain?\\nZipcar is becoming extremely dodgy this year , people beware of these practices. Being a member of a shared scheme that charge for “they do not know what” seems a dangerous scheme to be a member of. This is fraud.\",

The product is amazing, the app works really well, the innovative system for unlocking the doors is really, really good. Best of all, it solves an obvious demand! Renting cars is expensive and long term. This is the only short-term solution.\\n\\nYet Zipcar has been sold to one of the many failing corporate car renters, and Zipcar has inherited with it the abysmal customer service that makes hiring cars such a pain.\\n\\nI've had to call customer service on 4 separate occasions (reporting damage, my rented van was literally un-drivable from damage when I arrived, to chase up the fact I hadn't received a refund for a rental I cancelled before I'm fully charged, and to claim for credit for the inconvenience caused by making me walk 30 mins to another van because the one I rented was so damaged). EVERY TIME they were experiencing \\\"higher call volume than normal\\\" - even on email. In the middle of a global pandemic. Every time I called, the person on the other end of the phone was unhelpful. They were all nice people, and understood my issues, but were frankly useless at solving them. The poor staff haven't been trained properly.\\n\\nThis is an unbelievable disappointment. It's genuinely 5 stars for convenience and product. It solves a real need. It's a fantastic idea. But it's been absolutely obliterated by terrible, terrible mismanagement. The time I spent enjoying the product, and the ease of leaving the car on the side of the road has been made worthless by the painful communication with customer service to fulfil basic requirements for my service.\\n\\nPlease, please, for my benefit and others, sort it out!\",

They seem convenient and cheap compared to hire companies, but after they chuck in all the hidden charges, they aren’t. Be very wary of extending any rentals through their app - I was quoted enticingly low prices to extend my hire by 30 minutes at a time; the prices were shown in the app but I didn’t think to screenshot this because I never imagined for a second they would overcharge me and lie about it later... I was quoted +£5, +£2.02 and even +£0.62 to extend each time by 30 minutes. A day later they hit me with a bill which a) included mileage charges, which is mentioned in their terms and small print (check!) but that stung however I am livid that they also hit me with b) charges the extended hire which amounted to more than double that which was quoted in the app. And of course, they bill your card instantly so you don’t get a say in it and if you disagree with what they are doing - stealing from you by misleading you about their pricing in the app... well, strap in for a three month wait whilst they ‘investigate’ all whilst sending you bailiff notices and demanding the money even though there is an open dispute / investigation ongoing. Finally they will treat you by replying oh well as you didn’t screenshot the prices you were shown tough luck it’s your word against ours and we’re charging you anyway. Cheers zip car. As a second time user who might have used your service regularly since I got rid of my car; you have now ensured I will not spend another penny with your company ever again as you have totally lost my trust. Please heed my cautionary tale and try a standard hire company instead. At least they are upfront about the charges you can expect!\",

I called Tuesday…I was told they’d escalate it for me, and I’d get a call back that day…no call. I emailed via their online contact form…guess what? No response! I emailed a person who could not have been more helpful when I upgraded to a business account…he gave me an email address which turned out to be wrong.

    \"text\": \"My husband and I have been members of ZipCar for nearly 10 years and used to be big fans. They provided a reasonably-priced, convenient, easy hire service for people, like ourselves, who needed the occasional use of a car. Their biggest selling points were their excellent customer service (always friendly, helpful and genuinely caring) and well-maintained cars. We used to recommend them to everyone.\\n\\nNote the above paragraph is all past-tense. Over the last year and a bit we have noticed the company decline to a point where it is no longer a reliable hire company. This appears to coincide with the current owners, Avis, making sweeping changes to the company’s operating model. Any concerns raised have fallen on deaf ears; the company genuinely doesn’t seem to care that it is going downhill.\\n\\n1. Customer service - When picking up a car it is imperative to report any damage to ensure you are not charged (fair enough). Originally the telephone service was answered immediately and the advisor knew who you were based on the telephone number and they had all of the details of your booking to hand. It normally took no more than 5 minutes from start-to-finish, eating up little time into your booking. The customer service telephone system has changed to a “corporate style” where you have to listen to a pre-recorded message for up to a minute, wait several minutes in a queue (even at 9.15pm at night!) and then jump through multiple security hoops. It can take anything up to 10 minutes just to get to a point where you can report the issue. Then, in my case, there is often the pantomime of them trying to work out which car I have booked, because a flaw in their system means that a car booked by me is automatically transferred to my husband’s account at the point of opening the car with my ZipCard. In all recent experiences of speaking to the customer services department I have found the staff to be unknowledgeable about their cars, very script-based, incapable of handling faults and concerns effectively and generally uncaring.\\n\\n2. ZipCar does not have the infrastructure in place to speedily fix minor problems - at the start of my most recent booking, the car’s on-board management system alerted me to a low pressure front tyre. I phoned to report the fault and ZipCar were unable to confirm when this could be fixed. I was even willing to return 11 hours later to restart my booking the following day. As usual, there were no other nearby cars available due to it being a weekend. I therefore had to cancel the booking and miss an important meeting. It got me worried about what would have happened had I got a flat tyre whilst out and about. According to the review from 15th August 2019 I would have been stranded for hours (not great if you are a lone woman at night!).\\n\\n3. Just because you book a car, it doesn’t mean you will be guaranteed to have one for your timeslot - This is an extension of point 2. When you make a booking you are booking that car specifically. If it is unavailable ZipCar can’t guarantee a replacement. If your booking is at a weekend, the chances are all neighbouring cars will already be booked. I appreciate that a car is a mechanical device that can go wrong but when you hire a car it is generally because you need a car on that day for a specific purpose. It’s one of the fundamental reasons for using a hire company!\\n\\nOnce you are no longer able to trust a hire company to be able to provide a working car for your booking, the company’s primary function ceases to exist. Unfortunately ZipCar have successfully gained a monopoly in my area (no alternatives exist). We will be cancelling our membership and will sadly be forced to buy a car. Well done ZipCar for helping to add another car owner to Britain’s over-congested roads. Keep up the appalling work!\",

They then sent me a letter that my account was closed and if I didn't pay the outstanding £12, they would have to forward to a debt collection agency. I contacted them immediately, paid the balance, explained the situation and suggested in line with the many other subscription services who rely on card payments e.g. Spotify etc, they would need to factor in changes of card numbers and have a bridging time for this - but they said they could not take the risk and would not allow me to ever have an account again. Ridiculous.\\n\\n2) I managed a year later to create a new account. While using a Zipcar in an unfamiliar area, I unknowingly took a wrong lane for a number of moments and was sent a fine by the local council. I received an email from Zipcar that I would soon receive the details via post - but received nothing. They then emailed me that my account was suspended due to \\\"fraud\\\". I queried this and stated that I had never received anything about the fine via post and had they updated my address correctly with the council. (I had changed address twice in a year period across my subscription). Tenants at my old address out of the blue then received a \\\"court charge\\\" and an increase of the fine by 100% which they forwarded to me. I contacted the council who told me Zipcar provided the wrong address and I now had to pay the increased fine immediately due to the delay of payment. I am so angry with this company - 1) Receiving and paying a charge does not constitute \\\"fraud\\\". 2) Failing to provide the Council with my updated address which resulted in an increase of 100% on the fine (and if the tenants had not forwarded it to me, potentially worse!)\\n\\nThis company is a joke. I paid for it's service monthly for 2 years and used the service approximately 3 times. Now I really need the service and cannot ever create a new account or access my account due to \\\"fraud\\\".

Before I went I took time to decide between Virtuo (which is nice as you get to drive a Mercedes) and ZipCar. When I went through the app process on Virtuo the app identified my trip would cost an extra £50 in non-standard mileage. ZipCar on the other hand indicated no such thing. Believing ZipCar to be the cheaper option for a long trip I went with them.\\n\\nOn the trip the navigation computer didn’t work so I drive 800 miles checking my phone all the time - very dangerous.\\n\\nAnd then when I got back I checked the app a week later only to find out I got charged £150 for extra mileage. THATS A TOTAL 2-DAY COST OF £290 and £100 more than Virtuo would have cost.\\n\\nNaturally I raised this with them and was largely told that all of this was in the small print (including the dysfunctional nav system) and otherwise they couldn’t give a ****.\\n\\nPerhaps I missed a detail here, but usually a customer focused company would at least take a minute to consider that maybe they are slightly in the wrong and could do things better, but I basically got nothing else but defensive justification and blame.\\n\\nSecret charges even when you are looking for them, navigation systems that require you to look at your phone whilst driving, £100 more expensive than the nearest competition on exactly the same trip component, no notification on email of your final bill (it was only but looking in the app I discovered it) and horrendous customer service attitude.\\n\\nI shall be avoiding Zipcar at all costs out of principle in the future.

    \"text\": \"You cannot speak to someone in the registration department directly so you speak to someone who is a general customer service person. So if you have questions about your registration or insurance, the customer service person can only see whatever notes written by the department which can be requesting further information. The problem is that they can't actually help you other than repeating their policy and the notes on your profile. So you go into this back and forward with the customer service person where they will send a note to the department. They will then say they will call you back and never heard from them.\\n\\nWhen asking customer service for an update and they tell you that the department has sent an email with a request for further information, not once did I actually receive an email with the request (not even in junk mail) so not sure if they actually sent it or sent it to a completely wrong email address.\\n\\nThe email responses are all standard templates. So when you ask a question they copy and paste something which doesn't even answer your question. So again you go into a back and forward with whoever is responding every couple of days.\\n\\nWhatever you do don't cancel your account and then try to reinstate it. They get very confused by this for some reason particularly when you add an email address change. Apparently their policy needs your email address to contain your name in it, if not you will need to confirm that is your email. Never mind that you have already told them many many time throughout your interaction with them that this is your email address. It almost feels like they just make it up as they go along. Same with a copy of my license. I can't tell you how many times I have emailed them a copy of my license.\\n\\nSo far it has taken over 1 month and I'm still not registered.\",

Anyway, fast forward I parked the car up for had no idea how to lock the vehicle so called up an adviser to help me out who had the car locked but silly me left my scarf in the car so needed to get that back so she had unlocked it for me as I had set the alarm off and she sorted the alarm. Now we are in APRIL and of course we have COVID-19 where sadly I am unable to work and Zipcar have hit me with a £130 parking ticket + £15 processing fee. So I’ve contacted them all types of confused tickets are normally £65. Nobody can explain to me why I’m being charged £130 and why they have waited over a Month to notify me the car was parked in the incorrect location, I do not believe they just received this ticket. They scam their customers and I will be contacting the financial ombudsman to look into this further. I have the time and will fight this if not for the money but the principle.\\n\\nCertainly won’t touch them again. Disgusting. AVOID ITS NOT WORTH IT. Get an Uber lol\",

After being a loyal customer for over 2 years spending nearly £400 every month or more for 2 years they decide to ban me! Why? Because they would not let me appeal a parking ticket. I man to the extent they wouldn't even entertain it even though I had proof. I had previously appealed 2 others which I won one as I had evidence to show I was shopping and showed them a receipt from Asda for me to be able to use their car park for 30 mins. So this time they sent me an email and advised I got a parking ticket for somewhere I had never even been and on a day I was at work. I wanted to appeal it and to my surprise they refused and advised they have the right to refuse me appealing. But I have evidence and still they refused. Maybe the company is going through trouble with cover-19 but they decided to take the money for the ticket and not respond to my emails and no one picks up the phone anymore. For 2 months I chased this and I asked their senior managers to call me and no one ever did. I. then asked for all data held on me and for a subject access request and then a few weeks later after investigating my account they decide to ban me. What for? wanting to appeal a ticket? asking for data held on me? they said I was a security threat to them and their other customers. how ridiculous is that? they said they would not overturn the ban and I would never be able to drive a Zipcar again. This is disgusting, utter disgusting. I have a full trail of emails on how bad the customer service is here and how unfairly they have treated me and in all this all I wanted to do was to appeal a ticket and it has escalated to me getting banned.

I am well educated, have a great job and have paid any and all fees or fines to these guys and even was stranded once in their broken down vehicle for over 2 hours and waited til someone came to take the vehicle.

I registered with Zipcar in 2014 after passing my practical driving test, where I was told I wasn't able to open an account because I had no driving experience. Fair enough. 4 years later, I decided to go back and try again, as I was using Enterprise Rent A Car which didn't offer hourly rates. When I tried to re open my account, I was told that I could not use them as my account came up as suspicious or fraudulent (something along those lines). Following on from this, I spoke to a multitude of people, who told me they would be looking into my account. I was guaranteed that it would be looked into. But I got nothing. Finally, after months, they then told me that I would NEVER be able to use their services again. I have never used their service, ever, so I tried to escalate the issue. I was given NO explanation as to why I was banned from using them.\\n\\nIf this is how they treat their customers, I would advise everyone to steer clear, and use other rental companies available. Drive Now were amazing, but unfortunately, they stopped all operations in February. I hope this helps anyone out there.\",

    \"text\": \"The Pros: They are the only car company offering this service since Drive now pulled out.\\n\\nThe Cons:\\nThe app’s GUI is terrible when you are on a trip. It does not allow you to zoom out to see where you can park when you are on a flex trip and are in a no-park zone so you have to drive until you come close to a zone on the map which could be very far from your destination. This is imbecilic and frustrating.\\n\\nThere is zero customer service when you call up these days.\\n\\nThey seem to not answer emails anymore.\\n\\nThe cars recently have ALL been dirty. If they are cosmetically dirty (inside and out) this means there are ZERO COVID-19 cleaning regimes in place, no?\\n\\nI’ve booked a car and the car tyre was flat upon arrival recently.\\n\\nThe app did not lock the car despite me hearing the door lock (as did my guest) as we walked away from a flex car. I explained this in an email for Zip car and received NO RESPONSE. They charged me a full £60 which should have been only £20.\\n\\nZip car has to do much much better. They are seriously taking advantage of the fact that people are trying to stay safe and are using the service but putting in minimum effort.\",

    \"text\": \"Customer service is APPALLING!\\n\\nI have been a loyal customer for well over 10 years. Service has been getting steadily worse for the last few years. So bad now to the point that I have to write a review to vent my frustrations, as I can't even get hold of them directly to do so since they aren't taking calls 'due to high demand'? High demand of what, apologies?\\n\\nMost recently the fuel card was missing, so as prompted (managed to speak to someone that time, amazing!) I used my own credit card and emailed the receipt. Automated response to confirm receipt of message. But nothing after that for 48 hours, I then called to chase up, (amazingly, again) somebody answered. He explained he could see the refund request, didn't know why it hadn't been actioned, but said he would do it immediately. A week later, still not refunded. I did try calling a number of times during that week, kept being told they aren't taking calls 'due to high demand'.\\n\\nAlongside that I had a car booked for one hour yesterday, I arrive. No car. I check the app, it says 'booking is being updated'. I call them, (amazingly, again!) someone answers. I am told car has broken down. I ask why wasn't I told, either by phone, text or email?! He says it was only 45 minutes ago. WHAT!? How is that NOT ENOUGH TIME to contact me to say there's no car? He says he will cancel the current car, issue me a refund. However, the only cars available are Flex and that I have to book it online. He can't re-book it for me. I explain I don't have my glasses with me, won't be able see the app and will have to go all the way back home to do this. I go back home to book the Flex car, half an hour is wasted. Nearest one is 20 mins walk away! But you're only given 15 mins to hold the car. Lucky I had a bicycle then wasn't it? Car was also a Polo, smaller than the car that I had booked, it was being used to transport items for recycling and was a real struggle to fit everything in there.\\n\\nThis morning I checked my account. Car that was cancelled by zipcar rep was £7.50, no refund given. Flex booking round trip was over £17. No refund.\\n\\nI called this morning... guess what... they aren't taking calls 'due to high demand'. What an utterly useless company. It was clear to the operator that I was furious, how about head that off with making sure all the refunds had been made as soon as my booking had ended, so as not to make matters worse, and actually provide some 'customer service'.\\n\\nHopefully I'll get my money back before the end of the summer, probably requiring an argument, yep their staff sometimes argue with you, but I'm not gonna hold my breath. I am however going to look at options with other car clubs. Zipcar you officially suck.\",

I do not know if it is just now due to covid19 or in general. I contacted them 3 weeks ago because they unfairly overcharged me for the late arrival. In particular we arrived few minutes before the arrival time, but their app did not want to lock the car for some reason. I started calling them right away and I hoped that the car would lock itself at the end time of the trip but it did not. No one answered for 20 min. Next customer also arrived in the mean time and started calling as well, as she could not use the car before they are locked by us, but we could not lock them as the app button just did not work. At the end I think that after half an hour I just managed to lock the car from the web browser or maybe the car just locked itself, I am not even sure. But it was already 25 min into next customers trip and also they charged us as if we were 10 min late. I called them few more times to see why we were overcharged but no one ever answered. I wrote two emails as well and still nothing after 3 weeks. I will try to order the zip card before I use them in the future, as maybe that would prevent problems, however it is unacceptable for no one to be reachable by both me and the next customer for about 20min around the time we both had trips in progress. Who is the customer service for if not for people who are starting and ending their trip?\\n\\nP.S. check if the app works for you before taking a trip, as from my android phone it worked when I installed it but then did not want to log in once and did not work multiple times after, but luckily I could used the app with my friends iPhone.\",

You would think being able to unlock/lock a car is a ***basic functionality to a car***. Zipcar has so far been by far the worst. My car had 3 different on-board computer issues that clearly showed the car itself had lots of problems, no wiper fluid, and dented on all sides. I reported all of these at the beginning of the trip. When I arrived at my destination, I could not lock the car and had to waste the entire day to turn back - no parking card in the car, my zipcard hadn't arrived, and the app kept failing at least a dozen times of me trying with \\\"Sorry something went wrong\\\" . Even moved the car around to see if it's a reception issue (my phone had reception just fine) - nope, the card reader/whatever that is installed on the car that is trying to perpetually connect to the internet is terribly designed (I don't think it's the phone app's issue). Ruined my entire day's plan. On top of everything they charged me for over mileage. I was so upset, I contacted customer service to let them know the condition of the car, the fact that locking mechanism didn't work, the parking card is missing, etc. The customer service person was didn't answer any of my questions, and merely refunded the membership fee, a measly $7 (compared to $25 joining fee and over $160 in single day use, which, I returned early but they don't refund you for time not used). No other rental agency is this bad. This company clearly does not care about customers, and well, you might have issues with locking your car.\",

    \"text\": \"I wish I could rate in negative stars because that entire 5 star rating would be negative. Where to start. I a couple weeks agoI added a card to my profile and decided to make it my primary.(I ADDED not EDITED) and I thought it saved the information. Fast foward a little. I didnt feel like waiting for a bus in the rain for a ride and home was only a couple Miles away. I decided to try and reserve a car and My account was Locked. Thats strange. I called customer service and they said I had an outstanding balance of $20.00. I was shocked because i can remember my primary card already being charged for every ride. So I explained to her that my card was already charged and that I saw when they took it. And she told me it was an invoice and after a few minutes of looking into it she even clarified that it was paid for and to wait 1 to 2 business days. I shrug it off and went on about business thinking that they'll have it taken care of for next time i decide to book. This all happened about 3 weeks ago. Just on Saturday I decided I wanted to drive a little bit and Launched the app to see my account was still locked. I called them again and told them that my account was still locked and it was supposed to have been unlocked already and the reasoning that it was locked the first time. I got hit with another shocker. they told me that my card was NOT charged and that the outstanding balance still stands. Sketchy huh? After a bit of talking I decided to play nice and let them charge me again since obviously talking and fussing with them wasnt going to solve the problem. They told me that it would take 3 business days and that they will make it a priority for them to get the money they extorted me. So today I tried again and told them that my account was STILL LOCKED and they gave me the story that my card had insufficient funds. That wasnt even the case because i looked at my bank account and I had a whole darn paycheck sitting there. I remembered that I locked my card yesterday which is why they couldn't pull any money out. So after asking her if she would be willing to try getting it resolved as we are on the phone she said YES! I accidentally hung up on the lady while trying to pull up my app and unlock it. I call back right away and then another representative answered and He was the worst person in terms of customer service Ive ever dealt with. He told me that he couldnt help me in so many words and I got pretty ticked off at this point because he's not friendly and he refused to use any resources that he had. I asked him if he could call the financial group and see if they can pull it out so we can get this problem solved. He said that my account was already in high priority and it was all he could do. At this point my anger was reaching an all time high with this representative as he was NOT WILLING to help even a little. So after exchanging words a little bit (not aggressive or anything) I gave up and decided to end the call and try again with someone else after I calmed down. I tried again 2 hours after and I admit I told a lie because I was a bit embarrassed about how I came across before I hung up. I called and was greeted by that same dude......(thats where the risky lie comes in) I told him that a friend and I wanted to use reserve a car but the account was locked due to a outstanding balance. He looked again and told me that there was nothing he could do. I told him \\\"my friend wanted to reserve a car\\\" and he told me that it was against their policy. Fast foward I asked him if I could just speak with a manager because my anger was building again. He denied that there was no manager available to help me out with getting my account unlocked. I told him that there has to be someone else who can help since he wasnt willing to help. And he kept denying it. This is the sketchiest thing ive heard and the WORST customer service Ive experienced. Ive had bill collectors much better customer oriented than this pig head\",

    \"text\": \"It was a horrible experience with car2go today.Me and my husband along with our less than 1year old baby were going to Malta from Frankfurt for our 5days well planned holiday and just because of car2go staff ignorance and lack of proper car parking information at the airport we missed our flight. I still can’t believe that we have lost more than 2000 euros and our all holiday plans have got cancelled now just because of their negligence .\\nWe reached the airport on time and our flights were scheduled to depart @20.10pm to Malta . We were just searching for the assigned place to park our car2go car but after driving for atleast one and half hour at the airport surroundings we couldn’t find it and continuously called car2go guys to help us to find the place where we can park their cars .when they cudn’t help us we even requested them to let us park the car at one of the car park destinations with a parking ticket kept inside and charge us an additional amount as we were just on the verge of missing our flight, the staff over the phone didn’t help and did nit listened to our request and eventually we missed our flights to Malta . Since the only path to car2go parking have been closed by the airport authorities and there was no communication about this at the airport and neither the people whom we were speaking at car2go office knew about the alternate path to parking or additional parking spot. The best part is, at the entire Frankfurt airport car parking area there are no boards, no directions etc by car2go rentals to assist drivers to park their cars in this case when the only road we find was closed ,\\nWhat worst we could have expect from this company and its ignorant team.\\nI am in so much pain and feeling helpless as this was our most awaited holiday after we had our baby and we were going there to celebrate my birthday which falls on nov 7th.\",

Even worse, he was very unwell and coughing uncontrollably which is seriously concerning during the global pandemic we are in. After complaining using the app, I was refunded £26 and was told to chase the driver directly for overcharging me. I find that so surprising as the app is supposed to vett drivers and keep them accountable and this doesn’t seem to be happening. Very concerning and unreliable!\",

If it’s only 0.5% of your trip costs it would probably be fine l, BUT sometimes it can be higher than your total meter charge!! A £12 journey became £25 and I thought it was perhaps just the poor route. Until today I took a short journey the meter says £5.80 but the bill from the app is £10.60. Then there is small print telling me there is a “technology fee” in the finals bill @£4.80 almost the same with the actual meter charge. 100% surcharge??!! Making my trip costing doubt. Then I went back to my history invoices and found that some of my £20 rides contained a “tech fee” of as much as £11! What a rip off!!! I took black cabs to support those drivers hit hard by the Covid 19, but End up been victimised by the app!!\\nI would call out to BOYCOTT this “Gett” app but hail a cab on the street instead or use other black cab apps. How can “Gett” justify the 100% “Technology Fee” (TF)?! People riding black cabs aren’t fat cats or banks loaded with cash and just wanted to unload them. We work hard to make our money and Gett invented this “technology fee” to conduct frankly broad day light robbery!!! Shame on you Gett!!\",

However, I'd put this down to poor signal strength in my area and the service still proved to be better than the alternative. Yesterday I booked a cab and arrived at my destination only to discover that it wasn't possible to pay with cash as I'd always done previously, but also that the fare was going to be about 50% more than I'd paid in the past doe the same journey. I was horrified to see that the driver hadn't put the meter on!! Total rip off, shall avoid in future.
